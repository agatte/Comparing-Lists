# Comparing-Lists

Often people need to compare lists of items. Sometimes people need to determine what was missed. (i.e. what classes do you need before you can graduate?) Sometimes people want to see what they have in common. (i.e. what are common campaign factors for people who are elected?) Sometimes people want to know both. (i.e. What symptoms of this disease do you have and which do you not have?) For this project you are going to write a program that compares two lists.
You will write a program that takes 2 file names from the user. Each file contains a list of items (one item per line). Your program will output 3 different comparisons of the lists: items in both lists, items only in the first list, and items only in the second list.
